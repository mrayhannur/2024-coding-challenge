# 2024 Coding Challenge

This is not a project, but a motivation for myself to be disciplined. For 366 days in 2024, I intend to solve at least 1 coding problem each day on sites like HackerRank, Codewars, and others. And also, I do this in an effort to learn Python to be ready to become a Data Analyst.

_*This challenge was inspired by Mr. Sandhika Galih, a lecturer who has a very famous YouTube channel, "Web Programming UNPAS"._
